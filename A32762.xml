            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>ALL True Religion wherein Man can have any acceſs unto God, with acceptation, muſt be <hi>revealed</hi> to him by God; For tho Humane Reaſon, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining innate Light in Fallen Man, may ſhew him that there <hi>is</hi> a God, and but <hi>one</hi> God (as it hath done to ſome of the Heathen Philoſophers) And that this God is to be ſerved and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the Intelligent Creatures which he hath made, from his Right over them by Creation and Providence; and alſo from the Impreſſion of ſome Moral Principles yet abiding, <hi>Rom. 1.20. &amp; 2.14, 15.</hi> And ſo far Natural Religion hath gone of it ſelf, by the conduct of the natural light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Conſcience only; Yet never any farther, and rarely ſo far; ſuch is the loſt and deplorable state of <hi>Fallen Man.</hi> But for any Man to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to know <hi>what</hi> God is in his Eſſence and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence; and <hi>how</hi> this God will be worſhipped without <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> or beyond, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than he hath revealed is the highest and most irrational Preſumption in the World that <hi>vain Man who would be wiſe,</hi> can be Guilty of: For if <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Eden</hi> before the Fall, notwithſtanding all the perfection of his Creation, muſt have a <hi>divine Revelation</hi> over and above, to direct his right behaviour <hi>there,</hi> in his duty of obedience unto God: How much more is ſuch <hi>Revelation</hi>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:106783:3"/>needful to him and his Apoſtate Race ſince the Fall? Let them that deny the neceſſity of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> to the knowledge of <hi>what</hi> God is, and <hi>how</hi> he ſhould be worſhipped aright for his Glory, and Man's Eternal Welfare, if they own the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the Word of God (which many ſuch do not, therefore not to be Diſputed with as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, but as Heathens and Infidels) but read the Scriptures ſeriouſly, and for the preſent a few places here noted (only conſider them well) <hi>Job 11.6, 7, 8, 9, 12. Iſa. 55.8, 9. Deut. 29.29. Rom. 1.21.22, 23. ch. 11.33, 34. 1 Cor. 2.10, 11, 12, 14, 16. &amp; ch. 3.18.19, 20.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho moſt that profeſs themſelves Chriſtians dare not explicitely deny the truth of what is above aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted; yet many of them do practically and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatively deny it, by meaſuring the <hi>deep things of God,</hi> and the Mind of the Spirit, not by it ſelf, <hi>comparing ſpiritual things with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi> but by their own carnal, ſhallow and falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reaſonings and imaginations, as alſo by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up ſuch ways of Worſhip which he never or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; built wholly, or for the moſt part, upon Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authority, Laws, Tradition, Intereſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not on Christ. Such hath bin the <hi>abomination</hi> (ſince the working of the <hi>Myſtery of iniquity</hi>) which hath made all true Religion deſolate in the greatest part of the World profeſſing it, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending thereto.</p>
            <p>Wherefore as to <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of Divine Worſhip, the great thing controverted in the World among the many Ways profeſſed and practiſed is, <hi>Who can lay the beſt Claim to Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> And hence it is that <hi>We</hi> (pretending alſo to the like <hi>claim</hi>) do here, not only declare <hi>what</hi> we
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:106783:3"/>hold in this weighty Point, but make our Plea for the <hi>beſt</hi> Right to <hi>Divine Authority</hi> for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God in <hi>Congregational Churches:</hi> Which being the Sum and Deſign of the enſuing Treatiſe, 'tis needleſs here to inſist on.</p>
            <p>And if this appear to be a juſt <hi>Plea,</hi> it might be enough to lay a ſufficient Obligation upon the Minds and Conſciences of all ſuch as fear God, out of true Love and Loyalty to Jeſus Christ to fall in immediately to a chearful compliance therewith, in obſervation <hi>of all things which he hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> looking upon ſuch a ponderous weight in the <hi>ballance of the Sanctuary,</hi> abundantly enough to weigh down all other oppoſite Arguments of a lower <hi>alloy,</hi> ariſing from Prejudice, carnal Reaſon, or the Spirit of the World.</p>
            <p>But becauſe ſuch carnal Reaſonings, ly as ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-blocks before many, keeping them from a ready embracing the ways of God, it may not be amiſs to ſpeak ſomething briefly to ſome of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test <hi>Objections</hi> which are made against the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitutions</hi> here laid before the <hi>Reader</hi> in the following Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Some are ready to accuſe the <hi>Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Practice and Principles, <hi>As not comporting with Civil States and Government, and ſo would render them odious to</hi> Princes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe are either deeply prejudiced againſt <hi>all</hi> the Ways of God, or <hi>ſpeak evil of ſuch things which they know not:</hi> For, it's ſufficiently known to be the avowed Principle and Practice of ſuch as are of the <hi>Congregational</hi> Perſuaſion, That <hi>there's no Power but of God, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by him,</hi> and that they ought to be ſubject to Magistracy <hi>for Conſcience ſake,</hi> to pay Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:106783:4"/>and <hi>give unto Ceſar the things that are Ceſars.</hi> Their Lord and Maſter ſet himſelf for their Example in this, and hath left it, with his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept upon Record, which they dare not but obey.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Their Principles are diametrically oppoſite to the aſſuming or claiming a Power over, or ſhare in the Government of the <hi>Civil State,</hi> by virtue of any <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Relation, Miniſterial or other. What they lay claim to of Civil Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges is no more than what is equally due to them with other Subjects.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> As they are bound to believe by the Word of God, That they ought not to ſubject their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to Humane Will or Laws in ſpiritual things; ſo they believe it belongs not to them to ſubordinate and ſubject Magiſtratick Power and Laws to Church Cenſures, or require them to be Executioners there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; Chriſt's Government in his Churches being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat enough within its ſelf to anſwer all the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ends and purpoſes thereof, for which it was Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, without the inſtrumentality of any foreign coercive power whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> When Chriſt firſt inſtituted Churches, and for many Years after, they were to be under <hi>Heathen</hi> Emperors; which ſhewed <hi>(1.)</hi> That he did not Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain ſuch a Conſtitution as was deſtructive to <hi>any</hi> Civil Government, even the <hi>worſt. (2.)</hi> That the Oeconomy erected by Chriſt and his Apoſtles was ſufficient to anſwer all Intents and Purpoſes of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Juriſdiction</hi> without dependance upon the States and Princes of the World for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, and was fully practical under any <hi>Civil Powers,</hi> who would but permit the Profeſſion of Christianity according to Mens Conſciences.</p>

For <hi>1.</hi> Both the one and the other have the most deſirable Immunities and Priviledges granted by Charter in their reſpective kinds. <hi>2.</hi> There are no Members made by a <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive power,</hi> all voluntarily offer themſelves. <hi>3.</hi> There are no Members admitted or caſt out by an Arbitrary and Deſpotick Power, but all is done by the conſent of the Body Politick. <hi>4.</hi> A Church is made a Priſon to none, but any one may depart to another orderly and regularly, when called thereto. <hi>5.</hi> As all <hi>Members</hi> are admitted, ſo all <hi>Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Officers</hi> are choſen by Conſent and Agreement of the Body; none are impoſed. <hi>6.</hi> As all Tryals of offending Perſons in a Civil Corporation are by the Neighbourhood as to matter of fact, ſo in a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Corporation all ſuch Judicial Proceedings are in a way of Tryal firſt in the Church by the Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, upon whoſe Judgment of <hi>Guilty</hi> or not <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> the Elder paſſeth Sentence of <hi>Condemnation</hi> or <hi>Abſolution.</hi>

               <hi>Anſ. 1.</hi> Take this altogether, and it's a great queſtion whether ſuch an one hath Grace in his heart, or hath any good grounds of Hope that he ſhall go to Heaven: For it argues looſneſs of heart and life and <hi>Covetouſneſs which is Idolatry;</hi> yea, and plain Hypocriſie, that he would have his Child bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, meerly for form and Reputation ſake. For I would ſay to ſuch an one, <hi>1.</hi> Is not one Seal of the Covenant of as much weight to a Believer as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Wilt thou baptize thy Child as thy duty, and neglect the other Seal for thy Worldly Advantage, and ſo indulge thy ſelf in Sin? By what right doſt thou claim Baptiſm for thy Child? Is it by vertue of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant? And doſt thou openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:106783:5"/>it, and wilt not ſtipulate to the ſaid Covenant? How art thou ſuch a Child of <hi>Abraham</hi> as the Bleſſing is come upon? ſurely not the Bleſſing of Church-Memberſhip. <hi>Obj. But I hope my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant hath right to Baptiſm, tho I am no Church-Member. Anſ.</hi> He that himſelf is ſuch, as that if he were un-baptized, he hath no right to <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> cannot plead right for his Child: But no non-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber can plead right to any Seal, the Seals of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant being given to the Church, and not to the World; nor one Seal to the World, and the other to the Church. <hi>Obj. But I am a Member of the Catholick Church by my</hi> Perſonal <hi>Covenanting with God. Anſ. 1.</hi> Who knows what thy private and ſecret actions be; to verifie the Truth of what thou ſaiſt, the Church calls thee to Covenant with God and them: If thou wilt partake of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Church, and if thou haſt bin ſerious in Covenanting <hi>privately,</hi> thou wilt be as willing to Covenant <hi>openly</hi> with God and his Church; for he that Covenants <hi>ſocially,</hi> Covenants but <hi>perſonally,</hi> and he that Covenants with Christ, Covenants with him <hi>ſocially,</hi> tho ſecretly, for he takes him as Head of the Mystical <hi>Body.</hi> So that the Notion of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal</hi> and <hi>Social</hi> Covenanting makes not a <hi>legal diſtinction,</hi> having no ſufficient diſſentaniety of parts, they differing but <hi>ratione</hi> only, and ſo are but <hi>diverſa;</hi> not <hi>ratione &amp; re,</hi> ſo as to be <hi>vera op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſita. 2.</hi> Such <hi>perſonal</hi> Covenanting as you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, (if it be real) makes you but a Member of the <hi>Myſtical</hi> Body of Chriſt, not of any <hi>viſible Church,</hi> which alone is the ſubject of the Seals and other Ordinances. <hi>3.</hi> The Proſelytes publickly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant, and joined to the Church thereby, under the Old Teſtament, before they
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:106783:6"/>were circumciſed, and under the New Teſtament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were baptized. For the firſt ſee <hi>Deut. 29.11, 12.</hi> where the <hi>Stranger</hi> covenanted <hi>publickly</hi> with the Lord and <hi>ſocially</hi> with that Church in the Land of <hi>Moab</hi> juſt before they paſſed over <hi>Jordan,</hi> and were circumciſed by <hi>Joſhua, ch. 5.2, 3, 4.</hi> For the latter ſee <hi>Acts 2.39, 41. Peter</hi> makes them that manifeſted their Repentance, to ſtipulate publickly to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant before they were baptized; And as many as declared their glad receiving and embracing the Promiſe for themſelves and Seed were baptized; for they who did not explicitely declare ſo much were not baptized, as appears by the Text.</p>
            <p>In a Word, Doſt thou profeſs to be a Chriſtian? to have received Christ by Faith for righteouſneſs, and life, and to live Godly in Chriſt Jeſus? It is thy Duty then to join thy ſelf in Church-Fellowſhip, and thou ſinneſt greatly againſt God if thou dost not: For <hi>1.</hi> Church-Memberſhip is one of the great parts of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bleſſing, And wilt thou exclude thy ſelf from any part of ſo great a Gift? <hi>2. Church-Memberſhip</hi> is a Spiritual Bleſſing that a Believer is bleſſed withal in Chriſt Jeſus, And ſhall not that be valued by thee? <hi>3.</hi> A Believer in Chriſt hath right to Church Bleſſings, And wilt thou looſe thy Poſſeſſion for want of Claim? <hi>4.</hi> If thou art a true Believer, Chriſt is precious to thee in all his Offices, in all his Relations; as Head of the Body, Apoſtle and High-Prieſt of thy Profeſſion; Wilt thou not be of that Body Politick to whom he is the Head? of that Houſe over which he is Lord, that thou mayſt offer ſpiritual Sacrifices? <hi>5.</hi> He hath called thee out of the World, and thou art bound to <hi>come out and be ſeparate,</hi> and Covenant with God. <hi>6.</hi> However thou profeſſeſt to be <hi>with</hi> Chriſt; in
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:106783:6"/>this thou art <hi>againſt</hi> him, and ſcattereſt abroad. <hi>7.</hi> Haſt thou taſted that the Lord is gracious, and ſo art become a living Stone? then thou art to come to Chriſt the chief Corner-Stone in Church-Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to be built up a ſpiritual Houſe, and united therein by Joints and Bands, to be a fellow-Citizen of the Saints, and to help to fill up a holy Political Temple for a <hi>Habitation of God by the Spirit. 8.</hi> Thou wilt never grow kindly in Grace out of a Church; for that is God's Garden, his Vineyard which he Plants, Prunes, Waters with Bleſſings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually on all the means of Grace there. <hi>9.</hi> What Fellowſhip canſt thou have in the World? <hi>What communion hath Chriſt with</hi> Belial, <hi>Light with Darkneſs,</hi> &amp;c.? <hi>10.</hi> Thou lyeſt open to multitude of Temptations; and no wonder if God ſuffers them to prevail. <hi>11.</hi> Thou thinkeſt thou gaineſt as to the World by not engaging in Church-Fellowſhip, and ſaiſt it is not time to build God's Houſe, but dost thou not carry out much and bring in little, and put what thou getteſt into a Bag with Holes? <hi>12.</hi> To join to a Church of Christ is the highest way of glorifying God viſibly in the World. <hi>13.</hi> Thou canſt never have that Communion with God <hi>out</hi> of Church-Fellowſhip as <hi>in. 14.</hi> Whilſt thou profeſſeſt Christ and continueſt a non-Member, thou art a ſcandal to thy Profeſſion, and a means to harden the wicked.</p>
            <p>Now laſtly, It may be expected that we give ſome Reaſons of Publiſhing this ſmall Treatiſe. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are briefly theſe: <hi>1.</hi> For the Honour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; which is the main End deſigned, and all the following reaſons are in ſubordination thereto. <hi>2.</hi> Becauſe it's time to build, and God in his Providence plainly ſpeaks it, in that he blows upon our outward things, and blaſts them
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:106783:7"/>daily, becauſe we let the Houſe of Godly waste. <hi>3.</hi> To vindicate our ſelves againſt our falſe Accuſers, who render us ſuch as have little regard to the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whatever Chriſt commands. <hi>4.</hi> Becauſe moſt of the Writings of the faithful Builders are out of Print, or not eaſily obtained. <hi>5.</hi> Becauſe many good People that have a love to Christ, and deſire to walk in obedience to all God's Commandments, want due instruction in theſe Points. Hence it was earnestly deſired that we would Publiſh ſuch a ſhort Treatiſe, and we dare not withhold the Truth in unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>6.</hi> Becauſe of the great degeneration and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the life of Chriſtianity, and ſtedfaſt and cloſe walking of Churches in all the parts of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Order, that they may repent and do their first works. <hi>7.</hi> Not to <hi>impoſe</hi> on the Conſciences of any, but to hold forth unto them what light we have received from the Word of God, for the <hi>illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ignorant,</hi> the ſtrengthening the weak, removing ſtumbling-blocks from ſuch as are offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at us, and encouragement of all ſuch as are will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ready to build. <hi>He that hath Ears to hear let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches: In which, Glory be to God by Jeſus Chriſt throughout all Ages, World without End, AMEN.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>Sect. 1. THE Word <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Kirk,</hi> is moſt likely to be deſcended of the <hi>Greek</hi> words <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106783:8"/>God's Houſe, wherein he dwells by a more than uſual Preſence in the World. Of old God choſe a Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Houſe to appear and manifeſt himſelf in to his Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi>

Nothing is more evident by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than that an Artificial Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not a Church; for the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epiſtles to Churches, which could not be Dead-Walls, but to a People

               <p>§. 3. By way of Similitude, and Metaphorically, a Church is called an Houſe, a Temple, or Building, or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it being ſuch in a ſpiritual ſenſe

Chriſt hath inſtituted none ſuch. 2. They are never ſeen in <hi>coetu</hi> or in a Congregation (as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106783:16"/>a Viſible Church is) nor can be till the laſt Day
<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.41.</note>. 3. Chriſt never gave Ordinances for ſuch a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 4. All theſe are not under any viſible bond of Confederation toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is the form of a Viſible Church; Profeſſion is no Bond, but a proper requiſite only thereto. 5. Chriſt never inſtituted ſuch a Church Miniſtry, but what were ſet in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, and exerciſed in ſuch. The Apoſtles Chriſt's extraordinary Miniſters were firſt ſet in the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28.</note>, and were firſt Officers there, and tho their Commiſſion reached to the Planting and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other Churches that ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, yet they exerciſed not their Miniſtry, or Apoſtolick Power, to any ſuppoſed Catholick Church Viſible, nor wrote to ſuch, but ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered particular Churches out of the World, and in them ſettled a diſtinct Miniſtry and Ordinances pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to each, wherein they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed their own power, as far as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, for their Settlement and Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Again, there is no Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, Viſible Church, for 1. If there be, there is two Catholick Churches, which is a contradiction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that Creed called the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. 2. All viſible Profeſſors (if a Church) cannot be Catholick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not all the Members of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106783:16"/>Chriſt on Earth, and they that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs (at large at leaſt) are not Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt; many, if not moſt of them. 3. It is not a Catholick Church, becauſe it's not a Body-Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate, in any viſible manner, nor are capable of anſwering the ends of ſuch in Government, Order or Priviledges. 4. If there be a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, viſible Church, it's rational, there ſhould be a Catholick, viſible Paſtor; and from theſe Principles aroſe the Pope, and the <hi>Papal</hi> Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, eſtabliſhed throughout the profeſſing World.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Ages after Chriſt, each particular Church called it ſelf Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, from the Profeſſion of that Doctrine which was called the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith, becauſe received by all the Churches. Afterward the Word Catholick was applied to a ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Univerſal Viſible Church, and became not only ſerviceable to the riſing of the Myſtery of Iniquity, but a great Foundation of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Fabrick which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward built thereon, with all the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Tyranny, and <hi>Papal</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Pomp imaginable. The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that have caſt off the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Paſtorſhip of one, and will not endure a Catholick, ſingle Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, do moſt of them retain the Notion of an Univerſal Viſible
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106783:17"/>Church, as alſo of divers Catholick Paſtors, dividing that Catholocy, which they will not allow the Pope, among themſelves, each one exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing the Office and Power of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick viſible Paſtor, where-ever he comes, having bin ordained by a Presbytery of a Catholick Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to a Catholick Paſtorſhip, to the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>To conclude, Our beſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>Papists,</hi> have ſtill denied the being of a Catholick, Viſible Church, amongſt whom was Famous Dr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> whoſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon this Queſtion againſt <hi>Duraeus</hi> are Quoted by Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his <hi>Survey, ch.</hi> 15. <hi>p.</hi> 265.

Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſaith, Church is the Genus of all particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; but a Viſible Church in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerical conſideration, can no more be found exiſting out of individual particular Churches, than a Man can be found exiſting under the generi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal conſideration of Man, out of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106783:17"/>Men. But that a <hi>totum aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatum</hi> of all Churches in this World can be made, and be a viſible Church, he denies upon Learned and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Reaſons, which will ſtand their Ground againſt all contradiction. To whom, for brevity ſake, we refer the Reader, where alſo he evinceth that there's no Catholick Viſible Church, conſidered as a <hi>totum Repreſentativum, i. e.</hi> as a Repreſentative Church in all the Paſtors; that there cannot be a Catholick, Viſible, Repreſentative Church; and that there is no ſuch thing as a Repreſentative Church of any kind, of greater or leſſer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
               <p>§. 14. What the Scripture ſpeaks of a Church, is either of a Church in general, and indefinitely belongs to any, or of a Church in Specie, either Catholick and inviſible, or particular and viſible, but ſaith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Catholick Viſible.</p>

<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20 <hi>Col.</hi> 2.5.</note>, a Catholick being not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible as hath bin ſhewed: for a Viſible Church is not a Society gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and made up of all the ſelect People in the world, there is none ſuch can be here; but its ſuch as is limited to a People and Place, and is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Miniſtry and Ordinances there
<note n="b" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.23. <hi>Act</hi> 2.41.</note>. And though it ſhould be ſuppoſed that there is a Catholick, viſible Church (which cannot be granted) it is to be obſerved, that the Spirit of God, ſpeaks always of Churches in their reſpective places, as diſtinct Churches, each one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in it ſelf
<note n="c" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 2 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.1</note>; not one Epiſtle wrote to any under the Name of the Catholick viſible Church, nor to any Church or Congregation as part

Laſtly, the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the firſt Primitive was indeed the biggeſt and largeſt we read of, but to make it any other than a particular Congregation, is as weak Divinity as it is Logick, for it continued to Aſſemble together in one place
<note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act</hi> 5.12</note>, and was called but one Church, and was not the Church that was viſibly Catholick, for it contained not the Churches of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>

               <p>§. 5. Wherefore the Subject de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by us, is a particular Church; not becauſe the Catholick is a Genus of it, but becauſe the Catholick, and a Particular, are two diſtinct Species of Church, by proper Adjuncts, <hi>e. gr.</hi> A particular Church is viſible here on Earth <hi>in coetu</hi>

               <p>§. 6. The next general Nature (as we have ſhewed) to a Church is a Body Politick or Corporation, for Body is thus diſtributed in Scripture Acceptation, it is Natural or Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical; Political is Civil or Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; the Spiritual is a Church, which is a ſpiritual Body Politick; and that is inviſible and Catholick, or viſible and Particular. Here we are on a Particular Congregation, which we ſay is a ſpiritual, viſible Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.4, 5. 1 <hi>Co.</hi> 12.27</note>. That it is a Body in a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical ſence is moſt manifeſt, for the Scripture calling it ſo, it muſt be concluded, that it cannot be ſo in any rational ſence, but as it is a Body Corporate, not Civil but Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; it being of ſpiritual Matter
<note n="b" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1 <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1.</note>, ſpiritual Form
<note n="c" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5</note>, and for ſpiritual Ends
<note n="d" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 3.3, 7.8. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.19. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.9.</note>. Neither is it inviſibly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, for ſpiritual things are both viſible and inviſible

Hence the Church we are ſpeaking of is a viſible ſpiritual Body-Politick, and as ſuch having a ſpecial and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Relation to Chriſt the Political Head

               <p>§. 9. That explicite confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gives form to a viſible Church, appears beyond all doubt, 1. From the nature of its being a Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick or Corporation
<note n="a" place="margin">

Men may be very honeſt and good Subjects under the King's Government, but not incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated in any diſtinct Body Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate under the King. 3. They that are incorporated, are bound by a promiſe of Fidelity to the King the Political Head, and by a promiſe obliging to Memberſhip with, and fidelity to that particular Body. 4.

<note n="b" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12.</note>? 5. It is not fit that any ſhould partake of the granted Liberties and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges

As all theſe Reaſons hold good, as well in a ſpiritual Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick, as a Civil, and bear a great Analogy with the Natural Body of a Man therein: So likewiſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the ſecond place from the Word of God, ſpeaking of a Church as ſuch a Body. 1.

               <p>§. 6. A Church thus conſtituted is a true Church, and a Body of Chriſt; and tho its not yet orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized with Miniſterial Officers, yet it wants nothing of the Eſſence of a Church of Chriſt
<note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 27. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20</note>, for if a Church ceaſeth not to be a Church when it hath loſt all its Miniſterial Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and reduced to this ſtate, then this Church is an eſſential Church. Beſides, a Church muſt be before a Paſtor can be, becauſe that Relation muſt ariſe out of the Church, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ariſe from elſewhere, a Church being a Corporation by Charter from Chriſt; but yet though it be a true Church as to its Eſſence and Being, yet it is not compleat as to its well-being
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Titus</hi> 1.5</note>, in that it is not furniſhed with all its Priviledges that Chriſt hath purchaſed and provided for it, having not due in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for the adminiſtration of all Ordinances, or execution of the Power committed to it, in the moſt orderly and regular manner

               <p>§. 7. Hence the firſt ſubject of the Keys is a Church eſſential; for its impowered by Commiſſion from
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106783:32"/>Chriſt to chooſe its own Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Officers

               <p>§. 5. The Miniſterial Charge as to Adminiſtration of things of the moſt ſpiritual Nature in a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, is contained in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral Relation, and where God gives ability to perform it fully to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Church, <hi>One</hi> may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it duly

               <p>§. 6.

                  <p>
                     <hi>How a Church is regularly furniſht by Call and Ordination: A Call imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate or mediate: What each is: How a Church comes to a Call: And how made: The conſummation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no Ordination: A Perſon call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed being not a Member, ought to be joined to the Church calling him, before Ordination: None can or ought to be Ordained to the Catholick Viſible Church.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. A Church of Chriſt comes to be regularly furniſhed with a Miniſtry for its Edification, by a due Call
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4.</note> of ſuch as are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified thereto, and Ordination of them. A Church Calls, when after waiting upon God for Directions
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6 <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.38.</note>, and coming to be acquainted with the Grace and Miniſterial Gifts of a perſon or perſons, which having tryed
<note n="c" place="margin">1 <hi>Joh</hi> 4.1 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.10</note>, they are inclined to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him or them ſuitable for them, the Church gives him or them a ſolemn invitation to a Miniſterial Charge.</p>
               <p>§. 2. A Call to a Miniſterial Charge or Work, is either imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by God himſelf in a more
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106783:39"/>than uſual way or manner
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1.12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.1.</note>, or mediate by the Church of God; and every one that undertakes ſuch holy ſervice muſt have one of theſe two Calls, or elſe God ſends him not
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15.</note>: The immediate Call is when God doth qualifie and call a Perſon to a Miniſterial Service without the inſtrumentality of Men or Churches; and ſuch was the Call of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, whoſe Call was their Ordination and Infallible.</p>
               <p>§. 3. A Mediate Call is that which Chriſt makes by the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of a Church walking after Chriſt's commands
<note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2 2 <hi>John</hi> 6.</note>, but is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, but eventually may not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Churches end in Calling, becauſe the Perſon called may not be ſuitable, or for ſome reaſons may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to ſubmit thereto. Hence God anſwers a Churches Call, by ſending to them a Perſon fit and willing, whereby it moſt times proves happy and ſucceſsful
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.15 <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.37, 38.</note>.</p>
               <p>§. 4. The Church having wiſely and duly debated the whole matter, with all ſecrecy, and keeping things within the Church, and asked counſel of God and Neighbour Churches (ſo far as may be needful) and come to ſome reſult among themſelves, <hi>all,</hi> if poſſible agreeing without ſtrife and murmuring
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.3, 8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8.</note>, or at leaſt if any not ſo well ſatisfied, do conſent to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106783:39"/>in the mind of the Church, the Call is agreed upon; but by ſuch only who are actual Members, not by Members of other Churches, that communicate upon recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation only.</p>
               <p>§. 5. The conſummation of the ſaid Call is made by the free accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Perſon called
<note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2</note>; but ſuch Call and Acceptance (though neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary as Preliminaries) do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a Perſon in a Miniſterial Office, any more than a private Contract doth conſtitute Man and Wife, but Marriage by a Publick Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſufficient Witneſs: So that the Perſon Called, is not conſtituted in Office without Ordination, which is a Publick and ſolemn ſetting him apart.</p>
               <p>§. 6. If the Perſon called be not a Member, where he is to take his Church-Charge, he ought now, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſaid Call and Acceptance, to join as an actual Member to the Church
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 6.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12</note>: For to conſtitute a non-Member in Office is contrary to all the Rules of any Corporate Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>§. 7. A Perſon may not be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a Paſtor or Church-Officer at large, or before he be called to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation: For <hi>relates</hi> and <hi>cor-relates</hi> are co-eſſential to each other, and have reciprocal rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106783:40"/>affections: Ordination alſo is a ſolemn recognition of a Contract before made, which is done in the Call: Moreover, to make a Paſtor before a People call him, is to make a Paſtor to no body; and to Ordain a Paſtor upon ſuppoſal ſome People will chooſe him, makes him not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly precarious, but null <hi>ipſo facto;</hi> for being Ordained upon a ſuppoſed fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turition, makes his preſent Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion void, not being a capable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject till called to a Relation. And if it be ſaid, <hi>Such an one is Ordained Paſtor to the Catholick viſible Church.</hi> Then 1. Why did not that Church call him? 2. Why may not Deacons be Ordained to the Catholick viſible Church? 3. If he be Ordained Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor to the Catholick, how can he be Paſtor to a particular Church? unleſs he become a general and particular Paſtor, a double Paſtor; which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd. 4. What power have a <hi>few</hi> Paſtors or Churches to Ordain any Man to be Paſtor to the Catholick Church? as much power as an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated People, or the Mayors of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Corporations meeting together, have to appoint a common Mayor to all Corporations, or to make one another ſo.</p>

               <p>§. 2. But when Ordination (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its uſage in the Old or New Teſtament) is applied unto <hi>Men,</hi> it ſignifies only the inſtating any one actually in a Place or Charge that he is deſigned or called to. Again, in all the places, where our Tranſlators make ſuch uſe of the Word, there is not the leaſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Impoſition of Hands, tho the Word rendred <hi>ordaining</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act</hi> 14.23.</note>, ſignifies the lifting up of hands by way of Suffrage in Election of Officers.</p>
               <p>§. 3. It's thought generally, that Impoſition of Hands is only an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourary and peculiar Ceremony to the Ordination of Teaching Elders, and ſacred to them alone: But if the ſaid Impoſition be a thing eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to Ordination as ſuch, it muſt belong to all Church-Miniſters or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106783:41"/>as to Ruling Elders and Deacons: becauſe likewiſe the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Plea that can be made for lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of Hands on ordinary Church-Miniſters muſt be taken from the Ordination of Deacons
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 6.</note>, whereas indeed, we have not one inſtance of laying on of Hands on ordinary Teaching Elders in the whole New Teſtament, tho we read of the ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act</hi> 14.23.</note>.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Again, it's an Error com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received, that Ordination (performed by that ſuppoſed ſacred Rite) is only to be adminiſtred by <hi>Teaching</hi> Elders, whether of the ſame Church, or of other Churches, and is an authoritative act of <hi>ſuch.</hi> But this muſt needs be a great miſtake upon all accounts; for the Elders of one Church cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form an Authoritative Act in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it being a great Uſurpation
<note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.15.</note>; and the Elders of one Church having no power to Vote in another, which the meaneſt Brother hath, therefore how little power hath a foreign Elder to ordain or lay on hands in the ſaid Church. If it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to Elders only, ſure to the Elders of that Church in which the Ordination is, and to thoſe to whom Authoritative Acts do belong, and not to the Elders of another Church and Corporation, any more than the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106783:42"/>enſtalling the Mayor of one Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration appertains to an Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Act of the Mayor of another. But it may be truly ſaid, <hi>That Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Elders is oftner in Churches that have no Elders at all, than in ſuch that want one, and that have others ſurviving; Who then muſt Ordain a Pastor called to a Paſtoral Charge, and lay Hands upon him?</hi> Anſ. Who ſhould do it but the Church that call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23.</note>? Who ſhould put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Charge but Chriſt by them? for it's Chriſt inveſts any perſon with a Church Miniſterial Office by the Church where he hath placed his Name
<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Deu.</hi> 14.23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.6.11.</note>, which is his Preſence and Authority. He is the ſervant of Chriſt to his Church, and is its Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore, as called, ſo to be Elected and Inſtalled by it. Obj. <hi>But may the Church, having no Elders, lay Hands on him?</hi> Anſ. Either the Church muſt do it, or it muſt not be done at all; and if it be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be done, the Church muſt do it, being an Authoritative Act: Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Miniſters have no power to do it: (it's ſo in Civil Corporations, every Juriſdiction is diſtinct in it ſelf:) The power is in the Church to lay on Hands (if allow'd as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary) by ſome Brethren delegated and appointed thereto, and it ſtands with the greateſt reaſon, that they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106783:42"/>that have a lawful right to Call and Chooſe, have the true Right of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, and not they who have no power to Chooſe or Call. Beſides, while laying on of Hands was in uſe, (extraordinary Gifts being indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently beſtowed, as God pleaſed) it was performed indifferently by God's Appointment, as <hi>Ananias</hi> an eminent old Chriſtian
<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 9.14, 17.</note>, was ſent to lay Hands on <hi>Saul;</hi> and likewiſe, the Prophets and Teachers in the Church that was at <hi>Antioch</hi> (it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not that they were Elders there) were appointed by God to lay Hands on <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> tho at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time <hi>Philip</hi> an Evangeliſt could not lay Hands on them that were converted by his Miniſtry, confirm'd by his Miracles, and baptiz'd by him; but he having not power to convey the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt by laying on of Hands, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> came to <hi>Samaria</hi> for that end and purpoſe
<note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 8.15, 16, 17.</note>: Whence it appears, (<hi>Philip</hi> being an Evangeliſt, and an extraordinary Miniſter, having not the power of beſtowing the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt (tho he had them, and wrought Miracles) and therefore did not lay on Hands, tho he bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed) that this Ceremony was uſed according to the Diſpenſation (as God pleaſed) of the Gift of beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106783:43"/>confined by any Inſtitution to Elders or Brethren; and therefore one or other laid on Hands, as this Gift was by God beſtowed
<note n="f" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>to</hi> 11.</note>. And therefore it need not be any objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>That they that Ordain others by laying on of Hands must be in the ſame Office, and ſuperiour to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ordained, and hence Brethren cannot ordain a Paſtor.</hi> For we Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, That the Church is ſupream to any or all the Miniſters thereof, they being but miniſtring Servants thereto; that (ſuppoſing laying on of Hands be Ordination) the delegated Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that adminiſter the Rite, do it in the Name of Chriſt, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Church, it's needleſs the Perſons applying ſhould be in office themſelves, ſuperiour as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, or equal as ordinary Elders, it's enough, that they are impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er'd by Chriſt and his Church to this ſervice at this time. But the whole reaſon of this practice being ceaſed, the Rite it ſelf is alſo ceaſed, as above-ſaid, for no extraordinary, nor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gifts are now conveyed by laying on of the Hands of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, or of Brethren, neither is the Perſon ſo enſtalled, any better qualified for his place, either made honeſter or abler by a ſpirit of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or any more furniſht with Gifts and Graces, any more than a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106783:43"/>ſecular Magiſtrate (Mayor or others) is by the Ceremonies of his Inſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>§. 5. This Ceremony of laying on of Hands was of great Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and variouſly applied, for quite contrary ends, according to the Caſe it was conjoined with by Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or Humane Uſage. It was uſed in Prophetick Bleſſings

                     <hi>Acts</hi> 2.1, &amp;c.</note>, though we find not that this Ceremony was uſed in the New Teſtament by the Apoſtles, or the next followers of them, but upon the account of furniſhing the ſubject on whom Hands were laid with extraordinary Gifts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt
<note n="n" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14.</note>.</p>
               <p>§. 6. It is pleaded for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of this Rite in Churches (by ſome very irrationally) that its eſſential to Ordination of Goſpel-Miniſters: By others, not as Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, ſo as the not having it makes it null, but as neceſſary to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Honour of the Miniſtry: Others look upon it as indifferent, doing neither good nor harm, and that Ordination is never the worſe if it hath it not, nor never the better if it hath it, but it is only harmleſly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed. Laſtly, There are others think that it is <hi>obſolete,</hi> like the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Serpent in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s days, that had no healing vertue in it, a meer piece of Braſs: Such a thing now do many truly take <hi>Impoſition of Hands</hi> to be. We ſhall inſiſt upon the proof of this laſt eſpecially, which
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106783:44"/>being done, all the other will fall of their own accord, or by neceſſary conſequence.</p>
               <p>§. 7. The Arguments uſed for the continuance of the uſe of the Rite of <hi>Impoſition of Hands</hi> in the Churches, are 1. <hi>The laying Hands on the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the Apoſtles.</hi> Anſ. All acts of the Apoſtles were not Preſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to others. The Apoſtles laid their Hands on the Deacons, not ſo much as ſuch, but as Perſons to be furniſhed with an Extraordinary Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as appeared afterward by two eſpecially that were called forth to moſt Eminent Service for Chriſt, one, <hi>viz. Stephen,</hi> to ſet his Seal to the Truth of Chriſt by his Bloud, in giving one of the moſt Eminent Teſtimonies thereto, living and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the firſt after Chriſt's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 7.</note>. The other, <hi>Philip,</hi> was an Eminent Evangeliſt, who Planted the Goſpel and Churches in <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> was brought miraculouſly to the Eunuch, and Preached Chriſt unto him, who although he was ſearching the Scriptures, yet knew not that the Meſſiah was come till <hi>Philip</hi> opened the Prophet <hi>Iſaias</hi> to him
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 8.</note>. They that inſiſt on this Plea, ought to be as zealous for the formal <hi>Ordination</hi> of Deacons by laying on of Hands, as for the laying on of Hands on ordinary Paſtors, and more; there
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106783:45"/>being a ſeeming Preſident for the firſt, but none for the ſecond.</p>
               <p>§. 8. It's alledged, <hi>The Presbytery laid their Hands on</hi> Timothy
<note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14.</note>, and they ſay, <hi>The Presbytery was a Claſſis, or at leaſt a Conſiſtory of ordinary El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> Anſ. 1. That Inference wants proof, for that they were not <hi>all</hi> ſo is beyond Queſtion; for the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was among them for one, or elſe <hi>Timothy</hi> had Hands laid on him twice
<note n="b" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.</note>. 2. The Apoſtles were Presbyters, and call themſelves ſo
<note n="c" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1.</note>, and why might it not be a Presbytery of Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, ſeeing ſuch are mentioned by Name, and it belonged to them, and not to ordinary Paſtors to beſtow the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt by laying on of Hands? And 3. It appears that <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> received ſuch a Gift by the laying on of Hands
<note n="d" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18.</note>. 4. He was not made an ordinary Paſtor, but an Evangeliſt, the <hi>Ordination</hi> of whom we find was by the Apoſtles. As <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Ordination</hi> was a ſeparation to his <hi>Apoſtleſhip to the</hi> Gentiles
<note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 13.</note>.</p>
               <p>§. 9. It's alledged, <hi>That</hi> Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>is charged to lay Hands ſuddenly on no Man; which ſeems to be meant of Ordination of ordinary Paſtors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If it be ſo meant, yet it proves not laying on of Hands by ordinary Paſtors, for <hi>Timothy</hi> was not ſuch. It is not to be doubted, but the Gift
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106783:45"/>that <hi>Timothy</hi> received was ſuch an extraordinary Gift as was beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then frequently by laying on of Hands, and which <hi>Simon Magus</hi> would have purchas'd of <hi>Peter</hi> for Money, <hi>That on whomſoever he ſhould lay his Hands they ſhould receive the Holy Ghost</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 8.18, 19.</note>. This Gift, or the Rite of Conveyance, the Apoſtles were wary of proſtituting to Men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Minds: And therefore the Apoſtle warns <hi>Timothy,</hi> not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it raſhly to any, for it's appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent the Apoſtles laid not their Hands on <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> finding he had no truth of heart; but rejected him, and laid not Hands upon him, though he had bin baptized.</p>
               <p>§. 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. is pleaded, <hi>That Baptiſm and laying on of Hands were appointed as standing Ordinances in Churches.</hi> Anſ. This Text hath bin much miſtaken and abuſed: But briefly, it's not to be underſtood as if <hi>Baptiſm</hi> it ſelf, or <hi>laying on of Hands</hi> were to be underſtood to be the Principles there meant; for indeed, he ſpeaks but of one Foundation
<note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11.</note>, <hi>the Doctrine of Chriſt,</hi> which is laid in Repentance and Faith, held forth in Baptiſm, and confirmed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick Signs following Chriſt's Aſcention
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3.4. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16.</note>, in thoſe extraordinary Gifts conveyed by <hi>laying on of the Hands of the Apostles,</hi> and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106783:46"/>Men: Hence <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith, he found in one Copy, <hi>That Baptiſm and Laying on of Hands were encloſed by a Parentheſis:</hi> But if it be not ſo it matters not much, for it is the Doctrine of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>laying on of Hands</hi> which are here ſpoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> The Foundation-Doctrine of Chriſt, ſymbolically exhibited by the one, and miraculouſly, beyond all doubt, confirmed by the other in Apoſtolick times.</p>
               <p>§. 11. We conclude concerning this high applauded Ceremony which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> make Sacramental, and ſay it leaves an indelible Character, and ſome <hi>Protestants</hi> adore little leſs, That we find upon the beſt Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſtricteſt Scrutiny, <hi>That it is no continued Ordinance or Inſtitution of Christ in his Churches, And, That its an obſolete and ceaſed Ceremony,</hi> for theſe Heads of Reaſons only, for brevity ſake following:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the End and Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of this Rite is ceaſed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Rite it ſelf; for a Rite that ſignifies nothing, is an empty Sign and vain, and we ought not to do any thing in the Worſhip of God that is empty, inſignificant vain

               <p n="2">2. That Ceremony that none can by a due Authority apply, cannot be performed; but none ſuch are

               <p n="3">3. We have ſhewed that the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony was never appropriate to the <hi>Ordaining</hi> of any Miniſters; for it was a common Ceremony uſed in other Caſes, and to other Perſons: To the ſick

               <p>§. 12. It will be then enquired, In what manner a Church ſhould Ordain its own Miniſters: The Way is plain and eaſie, if Men make it not hard, knowing, <hi>That Ordination of any one to an Office, is no more than the Publick and Solemn Recognition of the Call, with his like Declaration of his Acceptance, whereby he is enstated in, and enters upon his Function and Charge.</hi> Therefore this Solemnization ought to be before competent Witneſſes, <hi>i. e.</hi> Churches

The Conceit that <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> may not be repeated is a <hi>Popiſh</hi> and vulgar Error: For as Churches are no more Priſons to Miniſters than People, and there may be ſufficient reaſon for the Paſtor, Elder or Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con to remove from one Church to another; in ſuch a Caſe a Man is to be Ordained again; and ſo if he change to another Church afterward; for one Churches <hi>Ordination</hi> of a Man cannot make him Paſtor to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

<note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.20.</note>, as Chriſt and his Diſciples, not kneeling or ſtanding, becauſe its a Feaſt, and ſignifies our eating and drinking Spiritually with joy and gladneſs, and though Prayer accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it, wherein may be Praying Geſtures, as in other Ordinances, yet Giving and Receiving here is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Ordinance from Prayer.</p>

               <p>§. 8. Chriſt hath not in either of theſe Seals preciſely determined the quantity of either Element to be made uſe of, neither what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Bread and Wine each ſhould take; or how much Water ſhould be uſed in Baptiſm; for our eating and drinking in the Lord's Supper, is not to ſatisfie our natural Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Thirſt

<note n="b" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.</note>. But our Saviour having told us what is ſpiritually intended and ſignified, it is ſufficiently manifeſt, that ſo much of each Element in both Seals, as doth hold forth to us the thing ſignified, is enough, tho never ſo little; for Chriſt hath not brought his Churches in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under a <hi>Moſaick</hi> Tutorſhip, ſo as to bind them up to ſuch quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities and qualities of externals, in manner as he did the Church of Old.</p>
               <p>§. 9. The Adminiſtration of the Seals belongs not to any but Teaching Elders, being moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to the Paſtoral Office to feed the Flock in this peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; for Chriſt when a Paſtor on
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:106783:56"/>Earth adminiſtred it, and therefore other Paſtors whom he ſubſtitutes when aſcended, ought to do it. Hence no private Member may be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally called thereto by the Church; if ſo, it renders Chriſt's Office need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and precarious. Nor no Paſtor of another Church may; for the Paſtor to one Church is no Paſtor to another; nay he hath no power to Vote, and therefore not ſo much as a private Brother to Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>

               <p>§. 1. AS the Keys are uſed in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Perſons to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, ſo in their departure from the Communion of a particular Church. And it is either in matters relating to the tranſlating a Member from one Church to another, or in ſuch matters as tend to his Excluſion from all Church-Communion. This and the former uſe of the Keys ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily depend on the Nature of a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:106783:65"/>particular Congregation: For if there be but one Catholick Viſible Church, and all other Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons but ſo many parts; it cannot ly in the power of any part to make one a Member or no Member of the whole; the whole of any Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being not at the diſpoſition of any minor part: But here every particular Church being a whole Houſe

               <p>§. 3. The Tranſlation of a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a Church is, when he goes from the Communion of one Church to the Communion of another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally, or in order to abide. He goes Occaſionally only, when he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a Recommendation, being a Teſtimonial under the hand of the Paſtor or other Elders, that he is a Member of ſuch a Church, walks as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:106783:66"/>becomes the Goſpel, and is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any Cenſure or Dealing for any Offence. This falls ſhort of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; for 1. It needs not any Vote of the Church, it being a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonial. 2. It needs not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to any particular Church, but to all it may concern. 3. There's no transferring of Church Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. 4. Such takes place only when a Church-Member is called for a Seaſon only by Providence to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with another Church. 5. In Caſe there be no Elders in the Church, a Teſtimonial under the Hands of ſome of the Brethren may be ſufficient
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 18.27. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1</note>.</p>
               <p>§. 4. A <hi>Diſmiſſion,</hi> or <hi>Letter of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> is that which is wrote from one Church to another, by the hand of the <hi>Elders</hi> (or in caſe ther's none, by ſome <hi>Brethren</hi>) by the conſent, and in the Name of the Church; wherein the Member asking the ſaid Diſmiſſion and obtaining it, is diſcharged from his original Relation to that Church, and is transferred to the conſtant Communion, Watch and Care of the other Church to which he is diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.1, 2.</note>. And in ſuch a Diſmiſſion theſe things are to be obſerved from the Nature of the thing it ſelf. 1. That the ſaid Brother diſmiſſed be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cenſure or Dealing of the Church diſmiſſing him. 2. That
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106783:66"/>the Letter of Diſmiſſion may be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with or without Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Caſe may require, or the carriage of the ſaid Member hath bin, tho he hath not bin under the Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church for any cenſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble action: Many a <hi>good Man</hi> prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>ill</hi> Church-Member (as ſuch an one may be an ill Husband) not carrying himſelf orderly and duely in his Relation. 3. That a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion be granted, either upon good Reaſon alledged by him, or upon his peremptory inſiſting upon it, for the Peace of the Church. 4. A Church-Member is not to be diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at large, to join to what Church he pleaſes; for 1. This is to diſmiſs him to himſelf, and not to a Church, the Church to which he is diſmiſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſpecified. 2. To diſcharge him from the Watch and Care of one Church, and not to transfer him to the Communion of another, is the putting him out of all Church Communion, and therefore an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretative Excommunication
<note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13.</note>. 3. A Church may not diſmiſs a Member to them that it hath no Church Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with, and therefore not to the wide World
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, 15.</note>. 4. As a Church is to watch over a Brother while he <hi>walks</hi> with it, ſo their Watch and Care ought to be extended to him when he departs, to ſee him
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:106783:67"/>lodg'd in ſafe hands
<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>He.</hi> 13.17</note>. 5. To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs a Brother to his own pleaſure, or to the wide World, is to expoſe him to Temptation; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly many ſo diſmiſſed have caſt off all Church-Watch, and joined to none at all
<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ro.</hi> 14.13</note>. 6. No other Church can duely receive a Brother ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, but as a Non-Member to any Church
<note n="e" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12, 13.</note>. 7. It argues no ſmall diſregard to the Order of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to grant ſuch a Diſmiſſion, and likewiſe it becomes a great Reproach to the Church and Elders
<note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.5, 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.3.</note>.</p>
               <p>§. 5. A Church may in ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes deny a Diſmiſſion asked. As 1. When the ſaid Brother is under Church Dealing. 2. When he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires only a Diſmiſſion at large to the World. 3. When he asks a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to a Falſe or Heretical Church: But if he ask a Diſmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a Church of the ſame Order, and give no ſatisfactory reaſon for it, and yet remains Peremptory in ſuch Demand, the Church ought not to refuſe the granting of it; for ſo to do, is 1. To keep a Man forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and to make the Church a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<note n="a" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24.</note>. 2. It is to <hi>Lord it over God's Heritage</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3</note>. 3. It is to lay a ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Block in his way, and to tempt him to rend himſelf off ſchiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally from the Church
<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ro.</hi> 14.13</note>. 4. It's to deſtroy his Edification, for he cannot

<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.16 <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.2.</note>. 5. It's contrary to Chriſt's Golden Rule
<note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.12</note>. 6. It may prove dangerous to the whole Church, proving a <hi>Root of bitterneſs</hi> that may infect many
<note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15.</note>.</p>
               <p>§. 6. Some Churches, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at leaſt, that walk by their own Wills rather than by any of Chriſt's Rules, will never grant a Diſmiſſion regularly to any. In ſuch Caſes a Regular Church is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to take ſuch Diſcharges of Members as an Irregular Church will give. And if upon the uſe of all due means they will grant none, the Church-Member ſo refuſed may join himſelf upon the terms of a non-Member, and ſo be admitted by the more Regular Church.</p>
               <p>§. 7. The management of the Keys in ſuch Caſes as have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to excluſion from all Church Communion, are ſuch as look that way by reaſon of the falls and offences of Church-Members; and ſo comprehend all due means that are to be uſed for the Recovery of ſuch as are fallen

               <p>§. 8. Excommunication is by the uſe of the Keys in a Judicial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the Church in the Name of Chriſt, whereby a Perſon is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and caſt out of Communion
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:106783:68"/>in all the Special Ordinances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

               <p>§. 9. Excommunication may be conſidered as <hi>direct,</hi> or more <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.</hi> Direct is the ſentence of the Church in the Name of Chriſt, for the caſting out of an impenitent or notorious Sinner from Communion of the Church

               <p>§. 10. A Church ought not upon every ſlight occaſion to proceed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Excommunication of a Brother, but upon the account of Matters of great weight, wherein the Honour of Chriſt, the Purity of Ordinances, and the Soul of the Offender are concerned; and ſuch offences do either call for immediate proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Sentence, or for a more gradual and mediate proceeding thereto
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Jude</hi> 22, 23.</note>.</p>
               <p>§. 11. When the matter of fact is moſt notorious and ſcandalous, paſt all Diſpute and publickly known
<note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.24. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4.</note>, then the Church is called immediately to proceed unto Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (notwithſtanding any preſent
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:106783:68"/>ſigns of Conviction and Remorſe) for the neceſſary Vindication of the Glory of God, the Church, and their Holy Profeſſion, and to manifeſt their juſt indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch wickedneſs
<note n="b" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11.</note>. So as it were to ſnatch the Sinner as a <hi>fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand out of the fire,</hi> waiting for a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded and tried evidence of his unfeigned Repentance under the Cenſure; the firſt and great End whereof is the Sinners Salvation, not his Deſtruction

               <p>§. 12. In caſe of Sins not ſo notorious, and more privately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the Churches proceeding muſt be more gradual, by all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours <hi>in the ſpirit of meekneſs, to reſtore ſuch an one to Repentance</hi>

               <p>§. 13. And here Admonition is of great uſe, which is an holy, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and wiſe Endeavour to convince the offending Party of matter of fact, and of the ſin of it, with the aggravating circumſtances attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as alſo to lead him to his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereupon, charging it upon his Conſcience in the ſight of God, with due application of the Word of God which concerns his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. And this belongs not to the Elders, in the firſt and ſecond
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:106783:69"/>degrees of proceeding in this Caſe; but to all private Members in their places, as matters may concern them, and are known unto them more or leſs

And firſt with much Solemnity, after he hath laid open the Sin, with ſeveral aggravations, he ſhews likewiſe the Awful Nature of this great Cenſure, and the main End thereof, for the Salvation, and not the Deſtruction of the Sinner, and accordingly calls upon God for his gracious Preſence and Bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Sacred Ordinance, that the great end thereof may be obtained,

Beſides this <hi>direct</hi> way of proceeding againſt an offending Member, there is another much of the like nature, which we call <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct,</hi> becauſe the Church puts not the Party out of its Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Party hath ſecluded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not by any regular way; but indirectly and contrary to all Rules of Order: For it is when a Church-Member, by reaſon of ſome offence taken at the Church, or ſome Member thereof not diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Duty, withdraws him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſeparates from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church. A Perſon having thus Excommunicated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:106783:71"/>as it were, the Church ought to conſider what is their Duty, and though a particular Member (or more) hath uſurped to himſelf the power of the Keys,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See Rom.</hi> 16.17. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6</note> the Church ought not to acquieſce therein; but maintain that Power which Chriſt hath committed to it; and tho it cannot hinder the inordinateneſs of a Brother's unruly Paſſions, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable Temper, when God leaves him to it, but that he will run away from the Church, rend himſelf off, breaking all Order and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Obligations, in oppoſition to all fraternal endeavours to ſtay him in the place that Chriſt hath ſet him in; the Church is bound to ſhew and aſſert the power of Chriſt which he hath entruſted it with, and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſhut the Door and turn the Key upon ſo ſinful and diſorderly a Departer from them, declaring that he having ſinfully departed from the Communion of that Congregation, he is no longer under its Care and Watch, and is not to return to the Communion of the Church as before, till he hath given ſatisfaction to the Church.</p>
               <p>§. 18. Some ſpeak much of and practice a Cenſure of <hi>Suſpenſion,</hi> when an offending Brother is forbid by the Church to come to its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the Lord's Supper, till
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106783:71"/>it appear whether he be guilty or no of the Sin charged on him.</p>
               <p>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath given no ſuch Rule to Churches to walk by: For till a Brother is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Convict before the Church, the Church hath no power to deprive him of any Church-Priviledges that belong to him by reaſon of his Memberſhip, and while the Church is in the way of its Duty, it is not guilty of the Sin of a particular Member. Hence Brethren ſin great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in withdrawing from a Church's Communion, becauſe a Brother (or more) lyeth under the charge of ſome Sin which they have not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced him of before the Church, either for the matter or Nature of the thing; till both which is done in the Judgment of the Church, he is not Convict, nor can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from Ordinances; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Convict and incorrigible, he is fully ripe for the Cenſure of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and there is no room for Suſpenſion; therefore Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion before Conviction is unjuſt, and Suſpenſion after is needleſs, and comes ſhort of Chriſt's Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. But if to gratifie ſome (through weakneſs ſtartled at the preſence of a ſuſpected, un-convict Perſon at the Lord's Supper, who is under the Church's dealing in
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:106783:72"/>order to Conviction) the ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Brother will forbear Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it is to be lookt on as an act of his own, but no Cenſure of the Church.</p>

               </head>
               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That there is Communion between Churches: Some things incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable in Churches: Some communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, and what: Wherein Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Churches conſists: In Caſes of Difficulties and Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, what is to be done.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. VIſible Communion is of Members in particular in a Viſible Church, a Body Politick or Corporate, which we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto. It remains that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be ſpoken of the Communion of thoſe Bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> Churches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom there is a Viſible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. And it is ſuch a common participation of viſible Priviledges of the Means of Grace in the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Ordinances of Chriſt, and a mutual Communication of benefits, as occaſion may ſerve, as is between co-ordinate Bodies Politick, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out infringement of their particular and appropriate Priviledges limited to, and bounded within themſelves only.</p>
               <p>§. 2. The Priviledges of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church are to be conſidered in Communion of Churches, as incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:106783:73"/>and as communicable. They that are incommunicable are ſuch as one Church cannot hand over to, or communicate to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without breaking the Charter, and overthrowing their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; and they are ſuch as theſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Church chooſeth its own Elders and Deacons, but cannot chooſe either for another Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such Miniſterial Officers being choſen, the relation ſtands firm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them in the Church which choſe them, and they are not El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or Deacons to another Church; the Paſtor and Deacon to the Church at <hi>Coloſs</hi> are not Paſtor and Deacon to the Church of <hi>Epheſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The doing of any <hi>Act</hi> which is inſeparably diſtinguiſhing to that Office Relation in the execution thereof, cannot be communicated or carried from Church to Church. As for Example, the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Seals, or uſe of the Keys are ſuch acts; therefore a Miniſter to one Church cannot diſpence them in another, becauſe they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by vertue of his Office, that is limited to one Church; nor can he transfer his relation, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Adjuncts thereof.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is alſo a peculiar Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration-Relation and Priviledge that a <hi>Brother</hi> hath in the Church
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:106783:73"/>of which he is a Member, and can have <hi>neither</hi> in any other, where he is not an <hi>actual</hi> Member: as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip in ſtated Fellowſhip under the Watch and Government of the ſaid Church; this he hath no where elſe: Likewiſe, he can Vote and give his Suffrage in any Church acts, which he cannot do elſewhere. Wherefore one Church cannot have Communion with another in chooſing or ordaining Elders or Deacons, any further than to look on and be Eye-Witneſſes of what they do; nor in admitting or caſting out of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There can be no Communion by way of mixing or conjoining powers (as there cannot be of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring;) any more than the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Briſtol</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter</hi> can mix and conjoin their Juridical Power.</p>
               <p>§. 3. But there are ſome things wherein Communion of Churches according to the Nature of them doth conſiſt; as in Natural Bodies there are things and actions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they can communicate to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo far as is conſiſtent with their Nature to commix or conjoin; but there are ſome things wherein its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible they ſhould, as in Senſation, or in the uſe of the Senſes, we may hear, ſee, taſte, <hi>&amp;c. with</hi> one another, but
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:106783:74"/>cannot transfer our Hearing, Taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Smelling or Seeing <hi>to</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So in Bodies Politick, there are ſome things we can enjoy or participate of together, and can communicate to each other; but there are others that we cannot. So it is in the Communion of Churches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may benefit by each others Gifts and Graces, the exerciſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are ſeparable from any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Relation that any one hath to a Church. Such things belong to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Communion, as to Expound, Preach and Pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor of one Congregation may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe in another, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his Paſtoral Relation, only as one that is Gifted for ſuch Services to common advantage.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is Communion in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and advice; and ſuch there was between the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and that at <hi>Antioch</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 15.</note>.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is Communion between Churches in giving and in receiving
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.15.</note>.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is Communion in reſpect of Members, ſo as one may recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend or diſmiſs Members to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but this cannot be in Officers; one Church cannot diſmiſs an Elder or Deacon, as ſuch, to another. Whatever Office a Man bears in a Church (it's ſo in all Civil Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations) he cannot be diſmiſt with
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:106783:74"/>his Office, but only as to his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip. The Mayor of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> may be transferred to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and taken in a common Member, but cannot be transferred as Mayor to the Mayoralty of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> no not for one Seſſions, Day or Hour.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They may communicate with each other as to fraternal Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ſpiritual Feaſts, ſo far as to give each other the right hand of Fellowſhip, as to the Members of true Churches of Chriſt; and hence the Members of one Church, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is, do partake in Ordinances with another, ſo far as Office-Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not concern'd. So the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of one Congregation partakes in the Lord's Supper with another; or brings his Child to be there baptized where the Paſtor is adminiſtring in his proper Place and Relation. But the Paſtor cannot come and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter either Seal in a Congregation to which he hath no Paſtoral Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor can be owned in any Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral act there. The Paſtor himſelf may <hi>receive</hi> in a Neighbouring Church, as a Brother of another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, but not as a Paſtor; much leſs can he <hi>adminiſter</hi> there as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor. It's one thing to communicate as a private Member, and another thing to diſpenſe as a Miniſterial Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. A Member of the Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:106783:75"/>of one City, yea the Mayor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, may be received with much wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as an approved Member of a Neighbouring Corporation at Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Entertainments, but muſt not ſit on the Bench there to do any act of Office, out of his Place, and out of his Power, whether the Mayor or chief Magiſtrate be alive or dead. So whether the Paſtor of a Church be alive or dead, the Paſtor to another Church hath nothing to do there as a Paſtor.</p>
               <p>§. 4. In Caſes of Difficulties and Differences ariſing in Churches, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Churches holding Communion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, may by their Elders and Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers meet together to conſult and adviſe about the ſaid Matters, and report to the reſpective Churches. Howbeit theſe Aſſemblies, as ſuch, are not truſted with any coercive Power or Juriſdiction over the Churches, to impoſe their determinations on them or their Officers. Beſides theſe <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional</hi> Aſſemblies and Councils, there are not inſtituted by Chriſt any ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Synods in a fixed Combination of Churches or Officers in leſſer or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Aſſemblies; nor are there any Synods appointed by Chriſt by way of Subordination to one another.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Christ appointed the Support of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Ministry: That Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters are to be maintained, prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Christ's Miſſion of the Diſciples; And by the Doctrine of the Apostle</hi> Paul.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. CHRIST Jeſus in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Churches, and external Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Ordinances in thoſe Churches, hath alſo appointed ſuch outward ways and means for the ſupport thereof, as is neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to his Honour and Intereſt in his eſtabliſhed Worſhip in the World; and therefore hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches ſhould miniſter of their Temporals to the upholding and maintaining of Spirituals, both Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>§. 2. The Subject which we ſhall chiefly ſpeak to now with much bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity is, <hi>To prove that thoſe Miniſters who labour in the Word and Doctrine ought to be maintained in a competent manner by the Churches or People that partake of their labours, ſo far at least as they are able.</hi> And it appears:</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:106783:76"/>
               <p>§. 3.1. In that Chriſt when he Ordained and ſent forth his firſt Preachers of the Goſpel, chargeth them not to go forth at their own Charges, both the Seventy
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 10.3, 4, 5.</note>, and the Twelve

                  <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.10.</note>; nay, he tells them how dangerous it ſhall be to thoſe that refuſe them to ſave their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>It ſhall be more tolerable for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> &amp;c.
<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. v.</hi> 14, 15.</note>.</p>
               <p>§. 4.2. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> inſiſts much upon it as a Duty, that he ſaw the Churches were backward enough to in his day, and would be more afterward. For</p>
               <p>He Argues from the Law of Nature and common Juſtice, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzle the Ox,</hi> &amp;c
<note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.18.</note>. It's an unnatural thing to ſtarve the labouring Ox, and not ſuffer him
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:106783:76"/>to take now and then a Mouthful of the Corn he treadeth out: Again, he argues from common Juſtice: The Day Labourer by the Rules of Commutative Juſtice, is to have his Hire: Again, he argues from the leſs to the greater, <hi>Doth God take care for the poor dumb Oxen</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9.</note>, <hi>and doth he not take care for his labouring Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters?</hi> And he tells us this was the Moral ſence of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, <hi>not to muzzle the Ox,</hi> &amp;c

                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9, 10.</note>. Again, he argues from the reaſonable expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all labourers in worldly Affairs; he inſtanceth in the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, that goes not a Warfare at his own Charges; The Planter of a Vineyard expects Fruit thereof; The Shepherd that feeds the Flock expects to eat of the Milk; and the Plowman and Threſher
<note n="d" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7, 10.</note>. If all theſe reaſonably expect outward ſubſiſtance from their labours, Why ſhould not he that <hi>labours in the Word and Doctrine?</hi> Again, the Apoſtle argues by way of compariſon of Temporal and Spiritual things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſhewing that ſpiritual things are much more worth than carnal; And hence ſaith, <hi>If we ſow to you ſpiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your carnal things</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.27</note>? Again, he removes an Objection that they would be apt to make from his own Example, and ſaith, <hi>That although he
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106783:77"/>took nothing of them for ſome ſpecial reaſons, yet he aſſured them that he had power to do it as well as others</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.4, 5.</note>, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that other Apoſtles did take Maintenance. He Argues alſo from the practice under the Law by God's Appointment, That they which did miniſter about Holy Things, liv'd on the Temple and Altar, and that God hath not taken leſs care of his Miniſters about Holy Things in the days of the Goſpel, but hath made <hi>Maintenance of Miniſters</hi> an Ordinance; He hath Ordained, <hi>That they that Preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel</hi>

               <p>You will ſay, <hi>Where did Christ Ordain it?</hi> It is enough if we be told ſo by an Inſpired Man, but it is eaſie to ſee that he Ordained ſo at his firſt Miſſion of Goſpel-Preachers, the <hi>Twelve</hi> and the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty.</hi> Obj. <hi>Paul took nothing of the</hi> Corinthians. <hi>Anſ.</hi> He tells us why, Upon the account of the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Falſe Teachers,</hi> That he would not be cut off from his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph upon this account, <hi>to stop their Mouths;</hi> but yet he ſaith he <hi>robbed other Churches,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> he took more of them than otherwiſe he would have done, even what he ſhould have had of the <hi>Corinthians</hi>) taking Wages of them to do the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſervice
